        <source>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find all the mines on the board without detonating any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Game Elements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;• Numbers:&lt;/b&gt; When you reveal a cell, a number may appear. This indicates how many mines are adjacent to that cell (in the 8 surrounding cells).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;• Blank Cell:&lt;/b&gt; If you reveal a cell with no adjacent mines, it will be blank and automatically reveal adjacent cells.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;• Flags:&lt;/b&gt; Use flags to mark where you think mines are located.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;• Question Marks:&lt;/b&gt; Use question marks (if enabled) to mark cells you&apos;re uncertain about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Game Strategies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;• Use the numbers:&lt;/b&gt; If a &apos;1&apos; cell has only one unrevealed adjacent cell, that cell must contain a mine.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;• Use flagged mines:&lt;/b&gt; Once a numbered cell has all its adjacent mines flagged, the remaining adjacent cells are safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When You&apos;re Stuck&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;• Try a different area:&lt;/b&gt; If you&apos;re stuck in one area of the grid, move to another section where you might find new clues.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;• Look for new patterns:&lt;/b&gt; Sometimes taking a fresh look at the board can reveal patterns you didn&apos;t notice before.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;• Use probability:&lt;/b&gt; In some cases, you may need to make an educated guess based on the information available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Winning the Game&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You win when all non-mine cells have been revealed. You don&apos;t have to flag all mines to win, just reveal all safe cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun and good luck finding those mines!&lt;/p&gt;</source>
