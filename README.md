**If you like my work, consider supporting me by buying Retr0Mine on steam!**

[![Available on STEAM](/.assets/available_on_steam.png)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3478030/Retr0Mine/)

I will continue to provide access to precompiled binaries here, but less frequently.  
A guide on how to build Retr0Mine by yourself will be provided soon in case you do not want to buy it, but still quick access to new updates.

# Download

**Note:** Steam deck users with firefox should right click on `Download` -> `save file as` and save to desktop.  
Remove `.download` extension after downloading.  
You can then click the installer on your desktop.
After installation you can right click Retr0Mine in your application menu and select `Add to steam` if you want to be able to run it from gamemode.

**Note:** ColorScheme cannot be forced on linux for now.  
I made a Steam Deck dark theme, available in gamemode session.
